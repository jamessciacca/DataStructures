Cant Create Objects from the Abstact Class
It has no body just the heading
It must be public!!!
The class must be declared abstract.
If you have an abstract class -> you do not need abstract methods within it.
You must override all abstract methdos in your sub classes, otherwise you will get a compiler error.


Interfaces can have abstract, default, or static methods

In a diagram the dotted line shows implementation of interefaces 
The solid line shows the extension of other classes.

Interfaces use the IS A relationship
EX - Fruit is a Apple

Interace VS Inheritance 
INT is used among unrelated classes, INH is where all classes are related

INT -
public interface Tossing{
    public abstract void expand(){

    }
}
INT can be used to declare varibales of intergave type, but not objects.
An INT can extends another INT
An abstract class cannot extend and Interface.
